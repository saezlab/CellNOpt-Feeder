Title: Integration of CellNOptR to add missing links
Version: 2.0.1
Date: 2015-14-08
Author: F.Eduati, E. Gjerga
Maintainer: E.Gjerga <enio.gjerga@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 3.6.0), CellNOptR (>= 1.4.0), graph
Suggests: minet, catnet, Rgraphviz, RUnit, BiocGenerics, igraph
biocViews: CellBasedAssays, CellBiology, Proteomics, NetworkInference
Description: This package integrates literature-constrained and data-driven methods to infer signalling networks from perturbation experiments. It permits to extends a given network with links derived from the data via various inference methods and uses information on physical interactions of proteins to guide and validate the integration of links.
